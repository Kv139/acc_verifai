How it works:
After confirming that the folder exists, the script will ask the user if they are sure they want to proceed with clearing the folder.
If the user types "y" or "Y", it proceeds with clearing the folder.
If the user types anything other than "y" or "Y", the operation is cancelled, and a message is shown indicating that the folder wasn't cleared.
This allows the user to confirm the action before proceeding with potentially destructive changes.
